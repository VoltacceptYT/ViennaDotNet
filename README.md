## Installation guide

### Requirements

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)
- Java 17 or higher (JRE)

### Instructions

- Clone the repository by running the following command on your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Earth-Restored/ViennaDotNet.git
```
- CD to the ViennaDotNet directory, then run "publish.ps1";
- CD to build/{configuration}/{profile};
- Run "run_launcher.ps1";
- Now on the same device open http://localhost:5000, create an account and login;
- Under "Server Options", set "Network/IPv4 Address" to your PC's IP address and either disable "Map/Enable Tile Rendering" or set the "Map/MapTiler API Key" (it can be found [here](https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/keys/) when logged in);
- Under "Server Status", click "Start";
- Accept the Minecraft Server's EULA when prompted in the Launcher's logs;
- Download and move the "resourcepack" file as described in the Launcher's logs;
- Download a tool to patch Minecraft Earth's apk, such as [Project Earth's patcher;](https://archive.org/download/dev.projectearth.patcher-1.0/dev.projectearth.patcher-1.0.apk)
- Install the app on your device;
- Make sure you have a LEGAL copy of Minecraft Earth installed on that same device;
- Open the patcher, press on the 3 dots then go to Settings;
- Under Locator Server, set the following:
```
http://YOURPCIPADDRESS:8080
```
- Now go back and start patching;
- Once that's done, congratulations! You can now open the newly installed app and play Minecraft Earth!

#### Launcher Buildplate Preview
1. To enable the buildplate preview, you must first obtain the Minecraft 1.20.4 resource pack.
2. The simplest method is to extract the files directly from the game's JAR:
   - Locate and open '1.20.4.jar' in your Minecraft installation folder using an archive viewer (like 7-Zip).
   - Navigate to the 'assets/minecraft/' directory.
3. Copy all folders from 'assets/minecraft/' and paste them into:
   - 'staticdata/resourcepacks/java/minecraft/'
4. Finally, toggle 'Enable Buildplate Preview in Launcher' within ServerOptions/Data Handling.

## Common Errors & Troubleshooting

### I cannot see the "Start Server" button when logged in
**Cause:** Only the very first account created on the launcher is granted full administrative permissions by default. Subsequent accounts lack the necessary privileges to manage the server.

**Solutions:**
* **Option A (Grant Permissions):** Log into the original (first) account and use the Manage Users/Roles page to grant server permissions to your second account.
* **Option B (Reset Database):** If you have lost access to the first account and need to start fresh, you can reset the user database. 
    * Navigate to: `launcher/Data/`
    * **Delete** the `app.db` file.
    * *Note: This will remove all existing accounts and allow you to register a new primary admin account.*
