# TODO

- Buildplate importing - Project Earth format - MCEToJava
- Buildplate preview in admin panel - SkiaSharp render lib + SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor
- Shop management
- Player buildplate management
- Player items management
- Encounter generation and AR
- Use tiles when spawning tappables - don't spawn on water/forbidden areas, spawn more trees in forest?
- Allow setting maximum cache size for tiles
- Allow custom java resourcepacks? (tool to turn them into earth(bedrock) resourcepacks)
- Some option to only allow custom login - because we cannot verify microsoft accounts
- Support importing Vienna data - if some data already exists - warn and merge
- Move logs folder up to the folder with run_launcher.ps1 - cli arg to specify log file location on all programs
- View old logs in launcher?
- Clear logs - seperate permission
- Show roles on profile page
- Export buildplates in both formats
- Launch/connect to remote components - e.g. run buildplate launcher on another PC
- Detect if the server is already running - require: EventBus, ObjetcStore, ApiServer and BuildplateLauncher
- Edit player buildplate name and scale
- View the player buildplate's template (if exists) - open page, search id?
- Add the level reward buildplates and add them to level ups
- NFC mini figures
- Some kind of auth for the logs, maybe pass a random secret to the cli args and verify it in the controller?
- A lot of things are quite slower on windows, investigate and/or add spinners

## Refactoring

- Get rid of LinkedList
- Use Guid instead of string
- Load static data types only when needed
